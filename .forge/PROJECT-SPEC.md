# PROJECT-SPEC.md — FORGESPEC
# Free AI Spec Generator by BotMakers
# Built with PRD-Forge Build System

---

# GATE 0 — IDENTITY

## System Name
ForgeSpec

## Tagline
"Turn any idea into a production-ready spec in minutes."

## What It Is
A free web application that lets anyone describe an app idea and receive a professionally researched, granularly detailed PROJECT-SPEC.md — the same document used by the PRD-Forge build system to generate production apps in Claude Code. ForgeSpec performs deep domain research, decomposes every feature into atomic components, identifies technical requirements, and produces a downloadable .forge zip ready for Claude Code.

ForgeSpec is the top-of-funnel lead generator for BotMakers and ForgeBoard. Every user creates an account (email collected), every spec generated is saved, and every spec includes a "Want this built for you?" CTA that links to ForgeBoard's paid tiers.

### What Makes ForgeSpec Valuable
1. **Deep Research** — Not just "what do you want?" but "here's what the best products in this space do, here's every component you need, and here's the technical requirements for each one"
2. **Granular Decomposition** — A client says "email client" and ForgeSpec returns 200+ atomic components across compose, inbox, threading, search, contacts, settings, and integrations
3. **Production-Ready Output** — The generated .forge zip works immediately in Claude Code. No reformatting, no guessing.
4. **Saved Specs** — Users can come back, iterate, version, and refine specs over time
5. **Free Forever** — The spec generator is always free. The upsell is "let us build it for you."

### How It Works (User Flow)
```
1. User signs up (email + password, or Google OAuth)
2. User clicks "New Spec"
3. AI chat asks about the app (guided conversation)
4. Behind the scenes: AI researches the domain (web search)
5. AI presents research findings to user: "Here's what I found about this space..."
6. AI asks follow-up questions based on research
7. User approves direction
8. AI generates full PROJECT-SPEC.md with Gates 0-5
9. User can review, edit, request changes
10. User downloads .forge zip (spec + system files + patterns)
11. Dashboard shows all saved specs with status
```

### Revenue Strategy
- ForgeSpec itself: FREE (lead generation)
- Email list: Every signup is a warm lead who wants to build software
- Upsell #1: "Build This For Me" → ForgeBoard ($199-499/mo)
- Upsell #2: "Have BotMakers Build It" → Done-for-you service ($5K-15K)
- Every spec page shows: "This spec would take ~30 minutes to build with ForgeBoard. Want us to handle it?"

## Who It Is For

| Role | Description |
|------|------------|
| user | Anyone who wants to generate a spec. Signs up with email. Can create unlimited specs, save them, download .forge zips. Free forever. |
| admin | Daniel / BotMakers team. Can view all users, all specs, analytics (most common app types, signup rates, download rates, conversion to ForgeBoard). Manages the platform. |

## What It Is NOT
- This does NOT build apps — it generates the spec document only
- This does NOT deploy anything — it produces a downloadable zip
- This does NOT require payment — entirely free
- This is NOT a code editor — users interact through chat and spec review only
- Out of scope: team collaboration, real-time co-editing, version control branching

## Entity Relationship Rules

- A user has many spec_projects
- A spec_project has many chat_messages (the research + spec conversation)
- A spec_project has zero or one research_report (created during research phase)
- A spec_project has zero or one generated_spec (created after conversation completes)
- A spec_project has many spec_downloads (tracked per download event)
- A spec_project can link to a parent_spec (for versioned iterations)
- A waitlist_entry can optionally link to a spec_project (which spec prompted the "build for me" interest)
- admin_analytics is a daily rollup, one per day
- feedback optionally links to a spec_project
- user.specs_generated is a computed count of spec_projects with status = complete
- user.has_downloaded is true once any spec_download exists

# GATE 2 — STATE CHANGES (SYSTEM PHYSICS)

## Auth State Changes

| # | Actor | Action | State Change | Preconditions |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | visitor | signs up with email | user created (active), verification email sent, logged in | valid email + password (min 8 chars) |
| 2 | visitor | signs up with Google OAuth | user created (active), avatar_url + name populated from Google, logged in | valid Google token |
| 3 | user | logs in | session created, last_login_at updated | valid credentials |
| 4 | user | logs out | session destroyed | logged in |
| 5 | user | resets password | reset email sent, password updated on confirmation | valid email exists |

## Spec Creation State Changes

| # | Actor | Action | State Change | Preconditions |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 6 | user | clicks "New Spec" | spec_project created (status=chatting), first system message sent: "What would you like to build?" | user logged in |
| 7 | user | describes their app idea | chat_message created (role=user), AI analyzes description | spec_project.status = chatting |
| 8 | system | determines enough initial context | spec_project.status = researching, research_report created (status=generating) | AI has app type + target audience + core purpose |

## Research State Changes

| # | Actor | Action | State Change | Preconditions |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 9 | system | Phase 1: Domain Analysis | research_report.status = phase_1. Claude + web_search performs deep domain research: (a) Finds top 5-10 competitors — name, URL, key features, pricing, strengths, weaknesses. (b) Searches for user reviews/complaints about each competitor (G2, Product Hunt, Reddit, app store reviews) — identifies top pain points, most-requested missing features, common frustrations. (c) Identifies the target user personas — who uses these products, what roles, what company sizes. (d) Detects industry/domain — if healthcare, finance, education, legal, etc. → flags compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FERPA, SOC2, GDPR). (e) Writes domain_summary covering market context, user types, regulatory landscape. Stores all in competitor_analysis + domain_summary. | research_report.status = generating |
| 10 | system | Phase 1 complete → present to user | Chat message: "Here's what I found about [domain]..." Summarizes top competitors, their features, and key patterns. Asks: "Based on this research, what should we focus on? Anything you want to do differently?" | phase_1 data populated |
| 11 | user | responds to research | chat_message created. AI incorporates user direction. | presented research |
| 12 | system | Phase 2: Feature Decomposition | research_report.status = phase_2. Claude breaks EVERY feature into atomic components, cross-referencing against actual competitor feature sets from Phase 1. For each feature area, checks: "Does Competitor A have this? Does Competitor B?" Ensures no common feature is missed. Example for "email compose": rich_text_editor, image_paste_clipboard, image_paste_drag_drop, attachment_upload, attachment_preview, inline_image_resize, cc_field, bcc_field, reply_to_field, contact_autocomplete, signature_insert, signature_editor, draft_auto_save, draft_manual_save, send_button, send_scheduling, send_later_picker, template_insertion, template_management, emoji_picker, mention_support, link_preview, spell_check, undo_redo. Also adds edge cases from user complaints found in Phase 1 (e.g., "users on G2 complained about no offline support" → add offline_draft_queue). Stored as nested tree in feature_decomposition with competitor coverage tags. | phase_1 complete + user direction received |
| 13 | system | Phase 2 complete → present to user | Chat message: "I've broken down every feature into its components. Here's the full breakdown..." Shows the feature tree. Asks: "Should I include all of these? Anything to add or remove?" | phase_2 data populated |
| 14 | user | confirms or adjusts features | chat_message created. AI updates feature_decomposition based on user feedback. | presented features |
| 15 | system | Phase 3: Technical Requirements | research_report.status = phase_3. For each atomic component, Claude identifies: required APIs/libraries (e.g., TipTap for rich text, DnD Kit for drag-drop), data models (tables/fields needed), edge cases (max file size, paste from Word formatting, etc.), estimated complexity (simple/medium/complex). ALSO generates: (a) Compliance requirements — if industry detected in Phase 1 (healthcare → HIPAA: encryption at rest, audit logging, BAA, access controls; finance → PCI-DSS: tokenized payments, no card storage; etc.). (b) Build estimate — estimated hours per feature area, total estimated build time, estimated API cost for ForgeBoard build. (c) Scale considerations — expected data volume, concurrent users, storage needs. (d) Infrastructure costs — estimated monthly hosting cost at launch and at 1K/10K/100K users. Stored in technical_requirements. | phase_2 confirmed |
| 16 | system | Phase 3 complete → present to user | Chat message: "Here are the technical requirements..." Shows key decisions: recommended stack, critical libraries, data model overview. Asks about integrations: "Does this app need to connect to any external services?" | phase_3 data populated |
| 17 | user | provides integration details | chat_message created. AI captures integration requirements. | presented technical requirements |
| 18 | system | Phase 4: Competitive Gaps | research_report.status = phase_4 → complete. Claude identifies: what competitors miss, what user's unique angle is, what the MVP scope should be (vs full product), where the biggest opportunity lies. Stored in competitive_gaps. | phase_3 complete |
| 19 | system | Research complete | research_report.status = complete, spec_project.status = generating | all 4 phases done |

## Spec Generation State Changes

| # | Actor | Action | State Change | Preconditions |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 20 | system | generates spec | generated_spec created (status=generating). Claude uses ALL research data (domain_summary, competitor_analysis, feature_decomposition, technical_requirements, competitive_gaps) + full chat history to write a complete PROJECT-SPEC.md with Gates 0-5. Every atomic component from Phase 2 becomes an entity field, state change, or UI element. Every integration from Phase 3 becomes a Gate 5 entry. Stack recommended based on requirements. Gate 5 must include for each integration: auth method, endpoints, webhooks (inbound + outbound), error handling strategy, rate limits, env var names, data mapping to entities. Gate 3 must include explicit RLS policies per entity. Gate 2 must include failure/rollback scenarios for complex state changes. If compliance requirements detected in Phase 1, they are woven into every gate (encrypted fields in Gate 1, audit logging in Gate 2, compliance permissions in Gate 3, compliance integrations in Gate 5). | research complete |
| 20b | system | validates spec completeness | After generation, system runs rule-based validation: (a) Every entity in Gate 1 has CREATE + READ + UPDATE/ARCHIVE in Gate 2. (b) Every entity has permissions in Gate 3. (c) Every FK in Gate 1 appears in Gate 4 adjacency list. (d) Every external service in Gate 2 has a Gate 5 entry with auth + endpoints + error handling. (e) Every entity state is reachable and has a terminal state. (f) No orphan entities. Produces a spec_quality_score (0-100) and validation_errors list. If score < 60, auto-fix and regenerate failed gates. | spec generated |
| 20c | system | generates ER diagram | From Gate 1 entities + Gate 4 adjacency list, generates a Mermaid entity-relationship diagram showing all entities, their key fields, and relationships. Stored in generated_spec.er_diagram_mermaid. Rendered in the spec review UI. | spec generated |
| 20d | system | generates build estimate | From Phase 3 technical requirements + entity count + state change count, generates: estimated_build_hours (range), estimated_api_cost (for ForgeBoard build), estimated_monthly_hosting_cost, complexity_rating (simple/moderate/complex/enterprise). Stored in generated_spec metadata. Shown on spec review page. | spec generated |
| 21 | system | spec complete | generated_spec.status = complete, spec_project.status = review. Chat message: "Your spec is ready! Review it below and let me know if you want any changes." | generation successful |
| 22 | system | spec generation fails | generated_spec.status = failed, retry with error context | API error or timeout |
| 23 | user | reviews spec | spec displayed in formatted view with all gates | spec_project.status = review |
| 24 | user | requests changes | chat_message created (role=user), spec_project.status = chatting, AI regenerates affected gates | reviewing |
| 25 | user | approves spec | spec_project.status = complete | no unresolved change requests |

## Download State Changes

| # | Actor | Action | State Change | Preconditions |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 26 | user | clicks "Download .forge zip" | spec_download created. System packages: generated_spec.full_spec_markdown as PROJECT-SPEC.md + .forge/system/ files (CLAUDE.md, BUILD-STAGES.md, BUILD-STATE.md, .cursorrules) + .forge/patterns/ (all pattern files) + .forge/design/ + .claude/settings.json. Zip generated and served. | spec_project.status = complete |
| 27 | user | clicks "Build This For Me" | waitlist_entry created (source=build_cta), redirect to ForgeBoard pricing page or waitlist confirmation | spec_project.status = complete |

## Iteration State Changes

| # | Actor | Action | State Change | Preconditions |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 28 | user | creates new version of spec | new spec_project created with parent_spec_id linking to original, version incremented, generated_spec cloned as starting point, status = review (user can edit immediately) | original spec_project.status = complete |
| 29 | user | archives spec | spec_project.status = archived, hidden from dashboard but not deleted | user owns the spec |

## Admin State Changes

| # | Actor | Action | State Change | Preconditions |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 30 | system | daily analytics | admin_analytics row created: total users, signups, specs generated, downloads, most common app types, API costs, waitlist signups, conversion rates | cron daily |
| 31 | admin | views analytics | read-only dashboard with charts | admin role |
| 32 | admin | exports email list | CSV download of all users: email, name, signup date, specs generated, has downloaded, waitlist status | admin role |

## Edge Cases

| # | Edge Case | System Behavior |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| E1 | User describes something too vague ("make me an app") | AI asks clarifying questions: "What problem does this solve? Who uses it? What's the core workflow?" Won't start research until it has enough context. |
| E2 | Research finds no competitors | AI notes this is a novel space, proceeds with technical analysis only, flags to user: "This appears to be a new category. I'll focus on technical requirements." |
| E3 | User wants a very simple app (1-2 entities) | Research phase is abbreviated (skip competitive analysis), spec generated faster. AI suggests: "This is a simple app — you might not need the full research phase." |
| E4 | Research times out | research_report.status = failed for that phase, skip to next phase or proceed without. User notified: "Research partially complete, proceeding with what I found." |
| E5 | Spec generation produces invalid gates | validation_errors populated, AI auto-fixes (retry with error context), user sees clean result |
| E6 | User tries to download before spec is complete | Download button disabled, tooltip: "Complete your spec review first" |
| E7 | User has 50+ specs (heavy user) | Pagination on dashboard, no hard limit, archive encouraged |
| E8 | Concurrent spec generation (user opens multiple) | Each spec is independent, no conflict |
| E9 | OAuth account already exists as email account | Merge accounts, link OAuth provider to existing email user |
| E10 | User pastes entire PRD or requirements doc | AI parses it, extracts key information, uses it to jumpstart research |

# GATE 3 — PERMISSIONS & DATA RULES

## Role Permissions

| Role | Can Create | Can Read | Can Update | Can Archive | Special Rules |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| user | spec_project, chat_message, feedback, waitlist_entry | own spec_projects + chat_messages + generated_specs + research_reports + spec_downloads | own spec_project (name, while not archived), feedback | own spec_project | Cannot see other users' specs. Cannot access admin analytics. |
| admin | everything user can + admin_analytics (auto) | all entities across all users | all entities | all entities | Full read access. Can export user data. Views analytics dashboard. |
| system | research_report, generated_spec, spec_download, admin_analytics | all entities | all entities | none | Automated via research + generation pipeline |

## Data Mutability Rules

| Entity | Mutability | Explanation |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| user | mutable | Profile updates, login tracking |
| spec_project | mutable | Status changes throughout lifecycle |
| chat_message | append-only | Conversation history is immutable |
| research_report | write-once per phase | Each phase writes once, never overwritten |
| generated_spec | mutable during review | Can be regenerated if user requests changes, locked once downloaded |
| spec_download | append-only | Tracking events, never modified |
| waitlist_entry | mutable | Status changes (pending → invited → converted) |
| admin_analytics | append-only | Daily snapshots, never modified |
| feedback | mutable | Admin can mark as reviewed |

## Row-Level Security

- Users see ONLY their own data (spec_projects, chat_messages, etc.)
- Admin bypasses RLS (service_role key)
- No user can see another user's specs, research, or conversations
- waitlist_entries are write-once by user, readable by admin only
- admin_analytics readable by admin only

## Data Flow

**Signup Flow:** Visitor lands on marketing page → signs up (email or Google) → redirected to dashboard → email collected + welcome email sent.

**Spec Generation Flow:** User creates spec → describes app → AI researches domain (4 phases, each presented to user for feedback) → AI generates PROJECT-SPEC.md with Gates 0-5 → user reviews → user downloads .forge zip.

**Research Flow (detailed):**
```
Phase 1: Domain Analysis
├── Claude + web_search → find top 5-10 competitors
├── For each: name, URL, features, pricing, strengths, weaknesses
├── Write domain_summary (market context, user types)
└── Present to user → get direction

Phase 2: Feature Decomposition
├── For each feature area (from competitors + user input)
├── Break into sub-features → atomic components
├── Example: "Inbox" → thread_grouping, read_unread_state, star_flag,
│   bulk_select, bulk_archive, bulk_delete, search_bar, search_filters,
│   search_date_range, pagination, infinite_scroll, pull_to_refresh,
│   new_email_indicator, realtime_push, swipe_actions_archive,
│   swipe_actions_delete, keyboard_shortcuts, email_preview_pane,
│   split_view, full_width_view, label_assignment, label_creation,
│   label_colors, snooze, snooze_picker, undo_actions, empty_state
├── Store as nested tree
└── Present to user → confirm/adjust

Phase 3: Technical Requirements
├── For each atomic component:
│   ├── Required library (e.g., TipTap, DnD Kit, date-fns)
│   ├── API needed (e.g., IMAP, SMTP, Microsoft Graph)
│   ├── Data model fields
│   ├── Edge cases (max file size, encoding, mobile behavior)
│   └── Complexity estimate (simple/medium/complex)
├── Aggregate into stack recommendation
└── Present to user → ask about integrations

Phase 4: Competitive Gaps
├── What competitors miss
├── User's unique angle
├── MVP scope vs full product
└── Biggest opportunity
```

**Download Flow:** Spec complete → system packages .forge zip → includes PROJECT-SPEC.md + system files + 28 pattern files + 5 design files + .claude/settings.json → user downloads → ready for Claude Code.

**Upsell Flow:** User sees "Build This For Me" CTA on completed spec page → clicks → waitlist_entry created → redirected to ForgeBoard pricing/waitlist page → email captured for follow-up.

### Key UI Components

**Spec Chat Interface:**
- Full-height chat with message bubbles
- AI messages render markdown with syntax highlighting for code/specs
- Research phase shows a progress indicator: "🔍 Researching competitors..." → "📊 Analyzing features..." → "🔧 Identifying requirements..." → "🎯 Finding opportunities..."
- User sees research results inline in the chat (competitor cards, feature tree, tech stack recommendation)
- Typing indicator while AI is responding
- Chat streams responses in real-time

**Spec Review Interface:**
- Tabbed view: Gate 0 | Gate 1 | Gate 2 | Gate 3 | Gate 4 | Gate 5 | Full Spec
- Each gate rendered as formatted cards (not raw markdown)
- Entity model shown as a visual table with colored status badges
- State changes shown as a flow diagram or numbered list
- "Request Changes" button opens chat with change context
- "Download .forge Zip" button (primary CTA, coral gradient)
- "Build This For Me →" secondary CTA (links to ForgeBoard)

**Dashboard:**
- Grid of spec cards showing: name, status badge, entity count, created date, download count
- Stats bar: "12 specs created · 8 downloaded · 3 in progress"
- "New Spec" button (prominent, coral)
- Search + filter (by status, by date)
- Empty state: "Create your first spec — describe any app idea and we'll research it for you"

### Marketing Landing Page (same Ledger-style)

**Sections:**
1. **Nav** — Floating pill: ForgeSpec logo, Features, How It Works, links, "Get Started Free" CTA
2. **Hero** — Mesh gradient. Badge: "Free AI Spec Generator". Headline: "Turn Any App Idea Into a Production-Ready Blueprint." Subhead: "ForgeSpec researches your domain, decomposes every feature into atomic components, and generates a spec document ready for Claude Code." Email signup or "Get Started Free" button. Below: mockup of a spec being generated with research phases visible.
3. **Social proof** — "Trusted by developers and agencies worldwide" + metrics: "2,400+ specs generated · 180+ app types · 94% quality score"
4. **How It Works** — 4 steps visual flow:
   - Step 1: "Describe" — Tell us what you want to build
   - Step 2: "Research" — AI analyzes competitors and decomposes features
   - Step 3: "Generate" — Production-ready spec with every detail covered
   - Step 4: "Build" — Download .forge zip, open Claude Code, build
5. **Feature Bento Grid** — 4 cards:
   - Deep Research (shows competitor analysis mockup)
   - Granular Decomposition (shows feature tree mockup)
   - Multi-Stack Intelligence (shows stack recommendation)
   - One-Click Download (shows .forge zip contents)
6. **Before/After** — Left: vague description "I want an email client." Right: 200+ atomic components organized by feature area. Shows the transformation.
7. **Testimonials** — 3 cards
8. **CTA** — "Ready to Build Something?" + signup form
9. **Footer** — Dark card, links, newsletter

### Model Configuration

```python
CHAT_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
RESEARCH_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"  # with web_search tool
SPEC_GENERATION_MODEL = "claude-opus-4-6"       # highest quality for final spec
SPEC_REVISION_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
VALIDATION_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
TECH_REQUIREMENTS_MODEL = "claude-opus-4-6"     # needs deep technical knowledge
```

### Estimated API Cost Per Spec

| Phase | Model | Est. Tokens | Est. Cost |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Chat (10 messages) | Sonnet | ~20K | ~$0.15 |
| Research Phase 1 | Sonnet + search | ~15K | ~$0.12 |
| Research Phase 2 | Sonnet | ~25K | ~$0.20 |
| Research Phase 3 | Opus | ~20K | ~$0.60 |
| Research Phase 4 | Sonnet | ~10K | ~$0.08 |
| Spec Generation | Opus | ~40K | ~$1.20 |
| Validation | Sonnet | ~5K | ~$0.04 |
| **Total per spec** | | | **~$2.40** |

At $0 revenue per spec, this is pure lead generation cost. If 10% of users convert to ForgeBoard ($199/mo), each free spec costs $2.40 but generates $19.90 in expected value. 8x ROI.
